### Sample Usage
Init plugin with `$(document).title('init')`.  
After that run `$(document).title('append', ' bar')`, that results in `title bar`.  
Now you can run `$(document).title('reset')` to reset your title to `title`.  
  
I use this plugin for adding notifications to my title. For example my title should look like this `benn0r.ch (1)`.
